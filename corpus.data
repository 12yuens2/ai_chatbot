im running a teamspeak server on my ubuntu box, I want some form of dynamix dns so i can have a name instead of give out my iip address how do I do this ?

check out no-ip for a free host service (dynamic dns)
i am looking at it now but when i click download it gives me an .exe ....
they have an ubuntu package if so do you know the name?
yeah it's the auto-update client.. what is your router?
uhm its an actiontec router given out by verizon for fiber internet
http://www.no-ip.com/support/guides/update_clients/setting_up_linux_update_client.html
that a try
its an MI424WR-GEN2
about that one, but a lot of router firmwares have dynamic dns built in. like cisco and dd-wrt
yea i just found it thanks for the idea, i had forgot they had it until u asked me what router then it clicked lol
i guess i can sign up at no-ip .org and put in the info in my router.

someone always helps me in here, then someone always says its not on topic
love irc ;-)

hrm so i made one, its called a host right? teamspeak77.no-ip.org but its not working lol
update the ip
its correct alrdy.
then just allow it some time for the dns changes to propagate
says its updated
website shows my correct ip do i need to open any ports, i heard the just wait part which is fine also ;-)
the account at no-ip to see that the host service reflects the ip change
it does, and my ip doesnt change anyway afaik on fios internet.
if you don't already have udp 9987 forwarded, you should do so
whatever port it's listening on (ts3 voice default is 9987)
yea i do for teamspeak
yea people ccan connect thats not an issue :-)
yeah then just wait for the dns i guess, lol
works now :-P
anyone help with trying to mkfs.ext4 for /dev/mapper/vg-root for encrypted drive?
just explain the problem
getting ext2fs_check_mount: Input/outputerror while determining whether mounted
is it mounted ?
tohught when i luksopen it mounted it
it has to be unmounted to put a file system on it
ty
/dev/mapper/vg-root isnt mounted... same issue
is this your root file system logical volume ?
vg-root is the fs for the external
?
why don't you explain what you are actually doing
im creating a fde external
?
pvcreate /dev/mapper/pvcrypt
"volume /dev/mapper/pvcrypt" successfully created
vg /dev/mapper/pvcrypt
group "vg" successfully created
-n root -l 100%FREE vg
volume "root" created.

what's a fde "external" ?
an "external2

full disk encryption
yes, FDE was explained, but whats an "external2
"external"
have an external drive i am trying to creat a bootable fde on
you're using lvm for that.....
on external disks, doesn't sound wise
i used cryptsetup. is that lvm?
question: some webpages are loading, some aren't. trying with both firefox and chrome, and my connection seems fine... lights on my modem are stable, and there is no lag or connection probs on irc
isn't working now, though it was a few minutes ago. not sure where to start looking for the prob
google works fine, but reddit doesn't.
DNS problems?
sortof comp illiterate... how would I go about checking that?
open a terminal window, and type ping www.google.com or ping <whatever site> and watch what happens, you can stop the pinging with <ctrl>+c
k. pinged google...64 bytes from atl14s07-in-f14.1e100.net. pinged reddit, 64 bytes from 208.46.17.24.... one thing I notice is that it appears to have taken longer to ping reddit; and it gave up after 6 times... I control c'd after it pinged google probably over 20 times
before you try to paste anything into the channel: please use a !pastebin - did the ping really start each time (with an IP address mentioned)? then it would not be a DNS problem...
noted. wasn't going to flood the channel lol. yeah, it started with an IP each time
you can install links2 - its a web browser for the command line - so you can try with another browser, the you can try the command dig <your.desired.server> - should return a proper IP address
tried with both firefox and chrome, but one sec
okay, what am I looking for w/ the information provided ?
with dig? only if there is "No error", then DNS is working and there must be another reason
okay... then not DNS heh
what does links2 say?
status:NOERROR
you can try that every time your browser is being difficult - do the pages appear in links2?
nope on google, nope on reddit, nope on ubuntuforums
are you using a proxy?
not that I'm aware of... connecting normally as always
if it makes any difference, firefox detects my IP the same as it is on irc, and it looks right to me based on previous IPs
time to provide some detailed info: pastebin 1) /etc/network/interfaces /etc/resolv.conf , the output of 2) ip ad, ip r 3) ping -c3 gserv.sytes.net
okay. one sec
http://pastebin.com/URLA3a4n take your time, no rush, I'll brb
well one thing comes to mind: you have your local router/access point configured as name server (like most do) - if that is in a bad mood ... :-)
hm
so is that..hmm, ISP problem? my problem?
although the ping to my server runs nearly fine (as 140 ms are a bit long that might point to your router/modem or your ISP)
alright. never experienced it before, wasn't sure what was going on
thanks
you're welcome :-) I wish you good luck - sometimes a reboot of the router/access point helps...
everyone. i downloaded the ubuntu 12.04 iso and tried to run it live. I got the Ubuntu 5-white-dot screen, but then it just became black. pls help. :-(
have you md5 test the iso ..
should i md5 test the iso on my hard drive or on the usb stick?
you should md5 test the iso before burnning the iso to the usb stick or other media.
md5 test is OK
from the livecd menu .. you see them F-keys on the bottom , right.
i don't reach the livecd menu
well , again .. are you sure you md5 test the iso and the hashs match !
isn't that ubuntu logo with the 5 or 6 white dots on one line
doesn't that shows on th login screen!
yes, i'm sure md5 number are exactly what is on http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/MD5SUMS.
i see the ubuntu logo with the 5-6 dots but there's n,o login screen.
am a bi counfused ..
what's confusing you?
as to what point you get stuck , aslo do you happen to have any external devices attached to the machine.
nothing attached except my Live USB stick.
here's what i see: black screen, then white ubuntu words in center, with 5 or 6 dots underneeath
i reboot after seeing black screen for 3-5 mintuse
, that black screen is releaed to defferent area , X for one .. but on a live cd a bit strange .
hold up ..
reboot while the usb stick atached, and after the BIOS screen keep pressing shift till GRUB menu shows up ..
you mean hold shift?
^
correct.
then press 'e' ..
while at GRUB menu press e
go to the line that start with boot /linux ..
then what?
Excuse my awful connection .. any progress with you !
then , you add nomodeset after quiet splash , then boot to the modified grub entry by pressing Ctrl+X .
i haven't rebootete yet. i am waiting to hear your answer: after i get to boot/linux line, then what?
can I find my firewall settings, I didnt install one but my DNS server keeps timing out I need to open port 53
type sudo iptables -L in terminal
http://pastebin.com/XuJ5G0yr
all I get
mhm you local firewall doesnt seem to block anything.

can you verify that nothing else blocks your connection to DNS? like your router?
I am in VM
that have anything to do with it?
could be. how do you notice that your dns has time out?
when I dig @my.ip.he.re mydomain.com
out
@127.0.0.1 returns fine
my IP times out
your ip means "internet ip"?
well doessnt matter
sounds pretty much like your can't get out of your virtual machine


can you configure something about that? do tcp connections work? or is it only udp?
how do I test that?
do you have a GUI on that system?

see if you can go to google: http://173.194.32.32/
yeah all internet connected aspects work fine
IRC
so dig google.com would work too? then i guess nothing wrong with your machine. you should see about that DNS server
?
google.com works fine
exactly am I missing?
i just think your domain / dns name is not configured correctly
could anyone tell me how to recompile alsa?
that's quite a big ask, why do you need to recompile alsa ?
alsa is pretty important to the sound system in ubuntu, are you sure you want to recompile it ?
ok, so why does that need alsa to be recompiled ?
to apply changes
isn't pencore-amr0.1 a seperate application ?
i am pretty new to ubuntu too http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencore-amr/ that's what people recommend in a discussion group, first install this opencore and then recompile alsa
give me a moment to look
: do you know any tutorial that would guide me step by step how to do it?
take your time, thx!
I can't see any information on that website that says the application needs alsa re-copmiling
I've not used this app before so I don't know, but I can't see anything that suggests alsa needs re-compiling
and @ scotty i need AMR-NB and AMR-WB encoding, plus as i told you i am a newbie, all of the ppl in the discussion group recomend compiling alsa after installing opencore amr in order to make pjsip work on ubuntu 12.04
I've never used this, so I'm only going back the documents
I wouldn't do that on a "guess"
I'd want to know for certain first
i tried everything i coudl think of, and the sound still doesnt work with this app
again, that's still not "I need to re-compile"
that doesn't mean you don't need to, I'd just want to be %100 certain it was needed before doing it
i really am new to linux and all of the ppl in this app discussion group who tried to make it work on ubuntu 12/04 write they had to
so maybe you could guide me through? or recommend a good tutorial?
guide you through what ?
recompilation of alsa
sorry, I've just said it's not something I would do unless a.) you know you need to recompile it b.) you know the specfic options your application requires
do you a.) know that you NEED to recompile it b.) know the specific options your application requires ?
as i told you the app still doesnt work, thats the only thing left to try thats recomennded, what do you mean by specific options?
no - you don't re-compile things blindly
if you NEED to recompile it, you'll need to change the default options (or it will just re-build how it is now, which won't work according to your theory)
so you'll need to know the compile options you'll need to make it work with your app
however again, unless you KNOW you NEED to recompile, I wouldn't try it, and if you do KNOW you NEED to recompile you'll NEED the specific compile options your app wants
saying "it's the only thing left" is not a reason to re-compile, more so if you have no reason to think it's the problem or no fix in compile options
anyone here? I need help!
i migrated to linux.. although i have gud hand on it.. i wnna ask u about kernel
you plz help me?
what's up ?
what's up ?
I want to compile kernel
ok, why ?
why do you want to compile a kernel ?
don't need to compile a kernel for that
just move the kernel to the pen drive and point grub at it
mv the kernel that's already built or copy it to the pen drive, then install grub to the pen drive and point it at the kernel on the pen drive
depeds if your machine suppports booting from bios
it has to be as that's what you are booting
no, that is the kernel source, not the kernel
look - what are you trying to do ? why are you doing this ?
ok, so just install ubuntu to the pen drive
that's all you need to do
neither
you need to install ubuntu to the pendrive
then nothing, you've got the whole OS ont he pen drive that will boot
I dont want whole OS in my pendrive. I just want few drivers which i need for a web browser to run..
you need the whole OS for the web browser
yes
then you cant do that
yes
told you, install ubuntu to the pen drive
look at the release schedule, look at the topic in #ubuntu+!
look at the release schedule, look at the topic in #ubuntu+1
yeah .. im looking for.. tx :))
sorry, that wasn't meant for you
what's not working ?
So I cannot sleep and did it anyway.

it such a problem when 12.04 was installed, that lsb-release was not installed?
seem to be found at all, according to the 12.04 terminal.
no need to become root, users can run the commands
yes, I am on 12.04, using my 3G connection. When I disconnect and reconnected before it worked, but then when I physically disconnect it from USB I cannot get it back.
lsb_release not lsb-release
there is a difference..

is it an LG 3G device?

it's trhe same result as thre 11.10 output anyway; No LSB modules.
fix and re-post anyway.,
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager/Hardware/3G search for vendor=0x1004 just need to change the product to: product=0x6141

Could I just like, use the Network Manager PPA and use latest trunk?
its not network manager, its the driver module
Well alright, I'll see where I can find to change the stuff I need.
ActionParsnip I am too tired to care.
exactly do I go to change the device info from 0x1004 to 0x6141?
you will need a config file in /etc/modprobe.d
how do I produce this file, if not already existent?
read the guide, it'll tell you everythng

okay,.
echo "options usbserial product=0x6141 vendor=0x1004" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/3g.conf > /dev/null
should do it
http://wiki.debian.org/Huawei/E220 should help, you may need the wvdial.conf define there too
I lose connnection after the first series of commands, I'm just gonna give up until I get some sleep, lol
ActionParsnip I don't have a wvdial.conf file in /etc.
yes, you may need to make it, you can make files in /etc you know
DISABLED
Ethernet interface
can I fix this?
do you boot into the BIOS menu, I've tried F1, F2 and F10
left ctrl
Thanks
sudo ifup eth0
does sudo lspci list your n-card ? isi it configured in /etc/network/interfaces ?
gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces
I don't see it using lspci
add two lines : auto eth0 and ..
They're already there dude.
save file, start networwing service
nitzs, AlanBell: Network was working on 10.04 if that makes any difference?
are you connecting via dhcp of your router ? what reveals sudo ifup eht0 ?
I'm connecting via VNC. ifup eth0 outputs:
Eventually ifup eth0 says: 'Failed to bring up eth0'
and is it dhcp orr a static routing you use ?
dhcp
where does the offer comes from ?
offer? I don't understand dude.
dhcpoffer, arp-request
Please forgive me, I'm very new to this, what you said doesn't make sense.
which device is the dhcp offered from ?
In /etc/network/interface dhcp is set on eth0 if that's what you mean?
is your router or whatever offerng the ip or is this part of the vpn ?
Part of the VPN
most likely an static address then
The server is a VPS, so I guess ThrustVPS are providing the IP :)
I.e. I don't have access to the physical machine
so up to you to see if is static or not and also configure the default gateway
can if force one of my soundcards to use 48kHz sample rate. that rate is supported but is not the default rate. i've tried editing /etc/pulse/daemon.conf but that had no effect. can i do it with an ioctl? in a script?
the playback (audio output) rate i need to set
asound.conf maybe?
i've tried it in .asoundrc which didn't help, but as i understand it that performs rate conversion and doesn't actually set the device rate
what's the program?
I did wonder if that was a callsign
tbh I think your best bet is to stop pulse and let wspr get at the sound card directly
can i stop pulse from using that card - i'd like to keep the rest of the sound system working on the laptop
I think so, but I'm not an expert; I tend to stop pulse by fairly brutal and unapproved means
did you use the .deb or build from source?
I tried wspr a while back but it was such a bloody awful mess I gave up
like pretty much all amateur radio software, it's an unmaintainable buggy pile of misfeatures with a hideous GUI loosely nailed onto the twitching corpse
yep, just read your 'review' of wspr above. can't argue with that
want another example? Xastir
want another example? Quisk
soundmodem, linrad, fldigi...
god yes. i had to hack that myself for a faster track update speed so i could plot ADS-B data. its a mess
fldigi isn't too bad but it's horribly crippled by using fltk
I gave up on it and started writing my own APRS tracker
but there is also tons of shite code that isn't ham radio related too
yeah, there's commercial radio software like GPS tracking software for Mototrbo, pretty much any commercial radio programming tools, pretty much any dispatcher software...
it's like there's some unwritten rule that any software to do with radio has to be written in Microsoft Visual Cobol for OS/2 95 by some guy who died ten years ago, with the GUI designed by a colour-blind orang-utan with an unrivalled collection of cortical lesions
yeah. at least the author of UI-View had the decency to take his shit source code to the grave with him
one thing I'd love to get time to work on is a UI chat plugin for libpurple
"How Hard Can It Be?"
get your mheard list and all right there in your chat proggie, integrated into the desktop
i wrote an AX.25 adapter for the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group's DTN2 reference implementation. That isn't shit code. But AFAIK, only me and my mate use it.
if you're doing APRS or APRS-like tracking, take a look at this: https://github.com/gordonjcp/aprsmap
that's not terrible code
will have a dabble with aprsmap later
let me know how you get on; it is known to be a bit crappy but basically functional
there information anywhere about the order in which packages are installed for Precise? I've been watching this update run over ssh for ages, and I'm curious how much longer I've got.
how long its been?

sorry, I don't know this IRC client very well yet
an hour, maybe two.
maybe it did something spooky with the ssh server.. you should use the program "screen" if you update via ssh
I'll keep that in mind for next time. I don't think there's a problem with ssh -- I mean, I'm still seeing stuff happen...
doesnt it say [x/XX] ?
does not. Just tells me what packages it's working on -- Preparing to replace, unpacking, selecting, etc.
maybe you chose a far mirror for downloading..
should have finished downloading a long time ago... it does that before installing anything, right?
y
btw you know the band speed? (it should say)
sure. I mean, my connection here tops out at about 2.5MB/s. Why do you ask?
ok.. but that's fast.. it shouldn't take even hours to download a cd iso at that speed
I don't think I was totally clear: it isn't downloading anymore. It's the install itself that's taking ages.
can you open another ssh terminal (are you able to?) ?
and see how much disk space is left (df -h /)
G Available. Just under half.
dmesg |tail , you get any hardware resets?
this usb?
few things happened -- what would I be looking for?
system's on an internal SATA hard drive.
anything saying like "sector" error or drive error, it may say "reset" (if it does then that's serious)
think so.
you seeing scrolling text? or does it appeared frozen?
If you're referring to the install, then: it's scrolling. dmesg stopped.
but maybe it finished downloading say i don't know.. and you thought it was installing for more time..
I'm not sure I follow?
thank you for taking the time to help me!)
do you know when it finished downloading before it starting installing?
i know there is a tool where a console can be observed by two people, while one types, after i ssh, can someone please tell me what it is ?
byobu.
that doesnt seem like it, i just read it quickly
Someone runs it with 'byobu'.
The next person does: "byobu attach".
Yes, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
00:20:19 < jpds> satwood: Someone runs it with 'byobu'.
00:20:31 < jpds> satwood: The next person does: "byobu attach".
;-)
so what do i do after ssh into ubuntu ?
Type: byoby
then the other guy to connect and see, what does he do ?
Are you even reading, what I'm typing.
yes
00:21:09 < jpds> satwood: 00:20:31 < jpds> satwood: The next person does: "byobu attach".
i saw i should i) ssh, ii) type byobu, iii) othe rperson types "byobu attach"
how does the next person know where/how to attach, so before iii) he also does ssh into the same ubnutu ?
and just types that ? is there a session number or tty number or something ? what if two others also want to do this separately on the same machine ?
You both need to be on the same Ubuntu system that's running byobu.
i got that. but lets say A and B do this. Now C and D also want to do the same. How is that possible if they do byobu attch, they may get attached to A
They can create a new 'client'.
how does D know to connect to C, instead of A ?
"byobu new-session"
"byobu ls"
wha tis the command C uses to connect to D instead of to A ?
"byobu attach-session"
is it byobu attach 2 ?
ok, how does C connect to A vs. connect to D ?
Probably, man page suggests "attach-session -t N"
ok thanks
Look at the tmux manpage.
do these apt-get error messages mean? http://dpaste.com/hold/816213/
that you installed a deb package by hand and not using apt-get or that you mixed repos
libc6 errors are serios when you mess up the packages for libc
course for correction?
what you did exactly?
mixing repos?
or downloading something by hand?
I don't even know exactly. You can read entire issue at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2073770
but you're right, I did try to manually install libc6
installing libc6 by hand is always!! a bad idea and will break the system normally
it was suggested by someone on ubuntuforums :/ I really didn't know what I was getting myself into
libc6 is the most important package on the system, when that gets broken you are in serious problems
what is the output of "apt-cache policy libc6"
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1294483/
output of "sudo apt-get install -f"
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1294485/
you installed libc6 i386 version on amd64?
ah sorry its just multiarch, everything fine with that
can you try "sudo apt-get install libc6" and paste the output
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1294487/
is it a fresh install?
dunno what is erroring in the pre-installation scripts exactly, but I've been going in circles the whole day
where was the libc6 package coming from?
nope, was working fine for months, ubuntu 12.04
where was the libc6 package coming from?
the one you downloaded
packages.ubuntu.com
and the package was designed for 12.04?
yep, certain about that
hm, you have aptitude installed? maybe that can rescue the issue
nope :(
here know Bash? :<
most of us do, also the people at #bash are experts
I agree, however, #bash is frankly quite dead and I'm not getting anywhere with resolving an issue which no doubt is staring me in the face!
dead? Its one of the most active channels I've ever seen.. most questions are answered in less than a minute. But feel free to ask here too
try to run this: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/e3de27d3/ but when I run it and agree to deleting the directory contents, it comes back with: rm: cannot remove `/home/sixil/Dustbin/*': No such file or directory
anyone made sound work via HDMI when using a dedicated ATI video card?
did you made this script, or copied from somewhere else?
made it.
move the /* out of "$all"
just want to delete the contents of the folder, not delete the folder completly.
11: all="/home/$USER/Dustbin" 20 Y) cd "$dustbindir" && rm -rf "$all"/*;;
you can also make "$all" an array instead of a string, this way: all=( "$HOME/Dustbin"/* ), and then you can expand it as "${all[@]}"
Well, you see it's just deleting the folder and everything inside it. I just want it to delete the contents of Dustbin, but leave the folder intact.
lines 37-41 uses perhaps *all* of thw worst bash practices...
Only been Bashing for 2 days, haha.
*never* try to parse ls
if you want to loop all files in a given dir, use an array: myfiles=( /some/dir/* ) ; for file in "${myfiles[@]}"; do....
I mean, it works, without a problem, the only issue is, it deletes everything. Would putting an array up keep the folder?
also, don't use echo prior to read... there is already read -p "some prompt or question goes here"
rm -rf "/some/dir"/* will *not* delete the dir, I promise you
Well, I put the array in, yet, I get this back: Aborting due to unexpected eof. Fix any mentioned problems and try again.
are you still using cat and ls > somefile ?
I only changed the all= part
also, why are you looping all files just to confirm with user for delete? there is rm -i for that
My task explicitly wants that.
rm -i already asks user for confirmation for every file
do NOT use "cd /some/dir; ls > tempfile; for file in $(cat tempfile)", this is atrocious. You can replace all of this for a single: for file in "/some/dir"/*
never, never, NEVER use the output of ls to do ANY file processing. ls output is meant for humans, NOT to be parsed by scripts. for most commands you can simply use the path directly in the command, as in "/some/path"/*

last but not least, some hints: 1 - endent your code, use 4 spaces (or a TAB) when inside an if or for block. makes reading code a LOT easier. 2 - build your vars one from another, to avoid inconsistencies: dust="Dustbin"; dustbindir="$HOME/$dust"; manifest="$dustbindir/.location", etc etc
notice that I've used $HOME instead of "/home/$USER". Remember the user's home is not necessarily at "/home". Also, do not use trailing slashes when assigning dirs to a var. Makes concatenating paths produce things like "/some//dir//"
you be more specific linocisco?
I can browser using mozilla. I can now chat on empathy. but I can't install any software or even on Terminal, I can't do apt-get update
do you have a fresh copy of ubuntu?
I mean was ubuntu installed recently?
you must open the update manager then refresh the packages list
no. itwas installed a month ago
you can reload the packages list from update-manager
I could not reload. it said check Internet connection
try changing the server maybe the default server might be offline
use the "select best server" option if possible
ok
now updating cache
the new server might over ride the packages list and you should be back to normal
now without changing server, it is working like normal. "updating cache" now. I will try apt-get in terminal
I m wondering if there is any CLI command like /etc/init.d/networking restart to update entry of changes in apt.conf
is the apt-get working now?
dont impress me to see I could configure apt.conf. because I was told and I read it on forum. without them, I could not do anything with confidence
ohh i agree
now installing from software center
hope so. thanks
do you use conky?
thanks for your active response in no time. I m sorry what is conky?
is it your site?
just discovered it a few months ago while surfing
its awesome aint it?
thanks
no [problemo]
now I just want to build ubuntu server to
I just want to setup ubuntu failover server to handle two different ISP lines
I have NEVER set up a server before can you suggest me how to set up servers?
no. I am to read from ubuntu documentation
why don't you tell us?
about what?
about what Dash and or Unity do by default.
I don't care what they do by default
they can transmit what I type directly to a team of stunt aircraft who write it in the sky with smoke trails, for all I care
you said mouthing off about stuff you read on phoronix.
yeah, it seems that everyone that whines about it has read the same article and actually doesn't know much about what's going on at all
the way I understand it the criticism is well founded.
I like the amazon plugin <shrug>
you did not respond to what I asked.
I didn't see you ask a question
it's probably more appropriate for #ubuntu-offtopic
oh, I answered that
it seems very on-topic to me.
it's not a support-related discussion, so it's offtopic for the support channel
in an actual company, it would be a support question.
it doesn't say 'technical support' in the topic.
it is completely on-topic.
you are just avoiding the question.
I answered your question twice.
that was for you.
okay, since you have trouble understanding it
everybody that complains about the Amazon shopping lens seems to make reference to the same article in Phoronix where they launched into their usual anti-Unity ranting
therefore, I tend to assume that *anyone* whining about unity-lens-shopping is doing so because they read the Phoronix article, and not because they actually dug into it
you still haven't answered the question.
you are only projecting your assumptions; something I could not care less about.
in which case I clearly don't understand your question
why is it wrong what the phoronix article says?
there are thousands of exit nodes.
and while it might be traceable for The Powers That Be, it is not traceable for you.
as such, you are just spreading complete misinformation.
ppl, my XFS partition is almost full and i need to grow the partition without lose my data
is a way to change the partition beginning point without move all data to the first blocks (like gparted do)?

take a full backup, then you have no worries about losing data
what is the output of: lsb_release -sc please
lisa
not supported here dude
mint has it's own support
should be possible, yes
you know any tutorial where i can do this?
according to:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Adhoc wpa2 isn't supported in adhoc
thanks for the info
do you have 3D accelleration enabled?
i think i have...
do you have openssh-server installed on the server too?
seems freenx does it
i will try, thanks
x11vnc also supports it. What are you doing on the remote system via VNC? There may be a sleeker solution
i just want to transfer files to my Windows PC via VNC without setup other software but more suggestions are welcome :)
you can access the drives as windows (badly designed) shares the 'C drive' by default in a hidden share
it also shares %WINDIR%/system32
you can use nautilus to connect to these hidden shares and transfer data with samba. Personally I think its a security flaw in WIndows but Microsoft seem to think it's a good idea
yes is true but just when i'm in the same network right?
as long as you have a logical connection, you can access it
now i can see Windows shared folder because i'm directly connected via wireless to my Windows Machine but when i connect to the router wireless, ubuntu cant see the shared folder, i think is something about some firewall configs on the router...
as long as you can ping the system you should be able to access the data
ok i will check, thanks again :)
you can access \\host\c$ and \\host\admin$ on ANY Windows PC if you have the admin password (poor security)
cool :D
you can use nautilus-scripts and add the feature there
ok
my linux system hangs after a large partition (3TB) is formated as jfs. Partition table type = gpt. Any hints why this happens ?
check your logs
/var/log/syslog ?
try there first
I dont see anything interesting there.
are you manually formatting it from the commandline or using a gui tool?
manually. mkfs.jfs
and there is no output on the commandline? just hangs?
the format completes successfully. Then, the machine freezes.
and the drive has been successfully formated? so you shouldnt have an issue now?
it is a test system at work. So, this has to be automatted without freezes. I am looking for the cause of this freeze.
also the partition cannot be mounted now. "mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on"
does it exhibit the same behaviour when you try format a different physical disk?
even the same disk formats successfully (and could be mounted) if the partition is smaller, say 500GB. Other disks (smaller) dont have problems.
tried running badblocks on the drive?
when mounting this jfs formatted 3TB partition, it fails and dmesg shows "FAT: bogus number of reserved sectors"
earlier tried formatting the partition as ext4; I was able to mount the partition after restart (the box frooze after format)
so I dont think it is badblock on disk that causes the problem
sounds like a hardware issue with the disk then? if you can successfully do what your looking todo at the start of the disk but not at the end
sorry did not get you. Both tries (ext4, jfs) was done the complete disk.
Why do you think it is a hardware issue ? I am able to create and use smaller partitions without any problem.
thats my point, the whole disk formatted with either partition type fails, but a smaller partition doesnt, create a number of partitions on the disk to fill it then format them all separately and see ifyou run into problems with any of them individually
okay.
you're not using MBR are you?
gpt
ok thats alright thought u would have been
created multiple small partitions to file the disk and then formatted each without any problem. Do you still think its a hardware bug ?
doesnt sound like it then, how long have u left the machine for sitting "locked up"? can you sys rq out of it?
left the "locked up" system for a minute at the max and then hard-rebooted it. I did not understand "sys rq" ?
is it possible it was still working on the partition in that time? or its returned you to the command prompt? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
mkfs returned to the command prompt with a success message.
Everyone, I had to leave earlier so I need to repost: we have installed an Ubuntu 11.10 server which we are having an issue with it not allowing connections after idle for approximately 2 minutes. We have to log on to the box and ping a network address for other network host to be able to connect to it again.Has anyone a suggestion as to the cause of this? Thanks
Have you looked at the logs to see if there is a clue there?
Could be an IP conflict as well. Have you checked the network for a possible conflict?
Is it on a static IP or set to a static lease?
When it goes down, can you ping it's own IP?
(Assuming you have a keyboard and monitor hooked to it...)
Have you been able to do updates on it? (Would be my next question.) ( sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade ) If it hasn't been done yet, try it and see if the process gets interrupted after the 2 minutes is up. (It would also be interesting to know if it happens at the exact time each time, so if you can, time it and see exactly how much time it takes... Can you correct it by restarting the network? i.e. /etc/init.d/networking stop
Actually, nowadays, we are supposed to use service, (the way RedHat'ers do it). service networking stop ; service networking start Or maybe just service networking restart (But I have found that stop and start are usually more reliable when trying to correct some kind of problem like this.)
Did this happen before the updates were done? (probably not, right?)
Yes, it *did* happen before updates were done?
Yes, might be a good thing to do. Especially since 12.04 is LTS
What NIC is it? lspci |grep Ethernet
Can you first tell me what Ethernet adapter it is?
And if it is 10/100 or 1000
Ok, is the rest of your network Gigabit? (And I know it *shouldn't* matter but...)
Particularly, is it connected to a Gagabit switch, (or router)?
Also, the cable. Can you replace the ethernet (cat5) cable? (Just to eleminate all possible problems).
I tried that yesterday as well, I should have mentioned that.
Well, sometimes that can be a problem, (from what I've heard), but I can't give any particulars, because, I've yet to run into it on my own.
Something like this requires some detective work. One other thing you could try, (which is what I would try next), would be to put another NIC in it and see what it does.
Surely you have another NIC somewere you can slap in it. Right?
... preferable not one identical to the one that is being used now too.
you having mentioned the port speeds reminds me that we had a customer who experienced up/down issues between a firewall and switch till we statically set the speeds on the ports. I will try that and see if it helps. will let you know. The NIC is virtual, this is on a vm
Well, you could still change it, even if it is on a VM, it's just that more than one system has to be told to use it.
When a network is converted to Gibabit, it is best to get rid of all 10/100 components.
and nics
Hope you're still here. Since you have let me know that it is a vm leads me to believe it is a vm setting that needs to be changed. Check the VM's settings for the network device of the guest.
ok I will check, am on phone with customer, will work on it in a few. Thanks
new nic, no difference. even tried setting speed and duplex statically, still disallows connections after a few minutes
guess I will proceed to upgrade to 12 to see if issue is resolved
upgrade did not fix it as well. However, was sitting here watching it via vcenter console and noticed after 5 min the screen turns off. Had to click and ctrl alt to get the screen back. This makes me think it is hibernating or something. Where can I check this?
anyone help me out with grub >
whole system wont boot
what's the error message.
rescue
invalid arch independent elf magic windows
at what point does it fail?
actually i had widnows first , then installed ubuntu and then mac on a hfs+ partition
fails on boot
is my default loader
DMI Pool data... grub rescue>
at what step in the boot does it fail?
dont even get the boot menu at all
Do you see the boot menu?

one bit
or grub2?

did you do to cause it to fail or did it never work?
i think what caused the problem as that i did sudo apt-get install grub in my root ubuntu install paritition and i have windows installed also...ever since i did that i got the error
apt-get install grub /dev/sda3
I think you'll need to boot a live cd or usb drive and maybe run boot-repair
already in live cd
usb

i just do boot-repair?
if it's installed
what is installed?

boot-repair
Gotta run.
thanks
do you multiple hard drives
i have partitions on a single drive on this laptop
can you use the grub cli to boot windows
how do i attempt to do that ?
when the machine starts and displays the grub menu push e or push c
ah i see. i looked a windows bit of the code earlier, but i didnt understand it
http://pastebin.com/PE6D5QgS
line 147
does something look wrong in there ?
yeah
did you manually edit the file
no
it was auto-created
that actually looks ok
oh
looks like my grub.cfg
is my win f'ed then?
don't know
you get a windows rescue disk
to boot windows using it
you have a windows 7 cd
rescue disk
reinstalling the windows boot loader
i dont have one :/ but i assume that is one answer
could be
did windows come preloaded
i bought this laptop, but the guy installed win 7 on it
can you access the windows partition from Ubuntu
yup i can see the files
sorry i am out of ideas
alright mate - apprecaite your help. thanks
that shouldn't need sudo
exactly but he got NO output so I'm just wondering
he probably typed it wrong
which broadcom does he have that you guys are trying to get working?
still trying to identify the card - might not even be broadcom
lspci? no need to make it more complicated than it needs to be
there was also canonical developer involvement
i beg to differ it worked perfectly
really?.. i tried that a few times and never got it to work.
it may be an upgrade, but unetbootin had no problem with it.
windows isn't listed as a supported OS on their homepage either.. so it must be very recent
I suspect you might be right ...
spidey sense tingly
trolling out of season
and forcing me to add another name to the /ignore list
same stuff different nick?
what? you think he's done for the day?
have we been trolled?
gee you think?
she was good, she started out like she had a real problem, but i wondered why the hell it took her 5min to tell me she had 7.04
points for creativity though. Not the USUAL racist rants/ubuntu slams/politco-religo propaganda
for sure.
bwahaaha! Wear your cowboy hat and video tape the event
lmao... (that was a hilarious video)
for some reason, people always seem to overlook that, and think wubi is a permanent install
the problem is, so few people properly use it.
true. too true.
don't give up now!
export to pdf IIRC
confirmed - export as PDF
ok, i thought it could ( i know i've done it lots of times w/ Libre, was pretty sure i done it with OO as well)
Yesterday I used /etc/network/interfaces to setup a static ip, and it worked great. Today, after a reboot, the interfaces are started (but not picked up by NM). I can ping my own IP but I can't access anything on the network. I'm thinking that maybe I get blocked because NM is refusing access somehow. I note that I can "disable" the network in NM but then all programs seems to have issues locating the interface.
anyone easily spot what I did wrong? Do I need to inform NM about the static IP in /etc/interfaces ? Where can i learn more about how the network stack starts in ubuntu 12.04 ?
have you looked in /ect/init.d ?

you mean I should read the networking script? :)
simply have to define a static address in /etc/network/interfaces and I think NM leaves it alone
This is what you think after googling the issue. And NM seems to identify that I messed with the file. There is a text stating that wired network isn't handled if you inspect the NM icon.
is that what youre trying to do?
I'm familiar with these documents: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/network-configuration.html
I set up a static IP: 10.0.0.6 default gw 10.0.0.1
worked fine yesterday.
reboot I'm unable to access the network, but a 'ifconfig -a' looks normal
isn't DNS, because I can't reach the GW
yes I checked physical network ;) )
issues I google talk about resov.conf being overwritten, however I don't have that issue. I just can't access the network .. it's as if I'm not defaulting to the gateway anymore.
way to see output of: cat /etc/resolv.conf, ifconfig, and route ?
^
Yes.. copy paste will be difficult though ;) ip route : default via 10.0.0.1 dev eth0 \n 10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link source 10.0.0.6
ifconfig -a gives me ip addr: 10.0.0.6 on eth0
resolv.conf contains two nameserver entries which I added in interfaces before
ie they were automatically added.
would expect errors like "network unreachable" or something. But I get 100% packet loss.
the physical network is ok)
so it looks like youve sucessfully created a static ip address. You think NM is causing the issue now?
can you ping the gateway?
no, if I ping the gw I get nothing. 100% loss. Not network unreachable.
yes, the theory is that some other process has hijacked the network
and is blocking access.. If i do tcpdump I can see some ARP traffic.
and I forgot the most interesting: I can ping from the gw 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.6 but not the other way around.
you using a desktop version of Ubuntu? do you see the network icon in the bar at up right corner?
yes
having trouble setting up netbeans c/c++?
Errr, how did you install netbeans?
i download it with just the java compliers and installed the c/c++ plugin
So under plugins, it shows c/c++ in the installed tab?
And there's a green circle with a checkmark by it.
yeah i think its not find the library
Under options, is there a c++ section?
which options?
yeah there's a c/c++ section
Under one of the menus, there's an options selection. It brings up a window where you can set general settings editor keymap etc... Also there should be a C/C++ section where you tell it what compiler to use.
If there isn't a tool collection, click add, setup one for the gnu compiler & tools
yeah i have it set to use gcc
Hum. Then I don't know what to tell you, since it's always worked for me, if I have the plugin and the compiler specified, it works. What isn't working for you?
i think the problem is the C dev library isn't included some how
i had to use synaptic to down the library
When you say the c dev library are you referring to ubuntu's or netbeans'?
ubuntu's
if you install the build-essential metapackage you should get everything needed.
build-essential metapackage? is that with the plugin section?
No in ubuntu. If you install that metapackage, you have all the libs and binaries ubuntu needs. That + netbeans + c/c++ plugin should be all you need.
ok I'll go look for it thanks
build-essential for creating debian packages?
Wait, you want to create .debs? That's a whole different set of packages, and I'm not familiar with them :/ sorry
no I'm asking because that all i could find called build-essential metapackage
Stupid question, did you make a simple c program and comile it from the command line? Did it work?
Make sure there isn't something more basic going wrong.
yeah that worked fine
i'm sure netbeans isn't finding the library which i why it's giving me 'can not find file' errors
I think it's time you checked with the #netbeans folks, sorry :/
okay thanks, but can you do me a favor? in c/c++ tab can you look in code assistance and post the directories?
sure.
can I find the swapfile. I think it's supposed to be in / but it isn't.
there is a swap partition, not a file... you cannot "see" it as such
it does not operate as windows does.
There is something crashing on my system all the time.
let us help you figure out what that is... it is not your swap partition
cat /var/log/dmesg | grep -i error
I've submitted a bug report to ubuntu a week ago but nobody is responding to it.
this release is a couple of weeks old with rather a lot of users. I know of no OS with ubuntu's level of response.
cat /var/log/dmesg | grep -i error yielded nothing
lspci -nn | grep VGA
sudo apt-get install i965-va-driver; reboot
OK!
After I installed that new driver. The pc hangs when I try to play videos...
of the thousands of installs I have scripted that driver to install for, this has never been the case.
Can I revert to the old driver somehow?
I'm not skilled at reading log files. I can try though.
[ 37.363689] lp: driver loaded but no devices found
told me to look for errors in /var/log/dmesg. Could this be something? [ 37.363689] lp: driver loaded but no devices found
[ 37.363689] lp: driver loaded but no devices found. Could that be of interest?
apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-video-intel
sudo update-pciids
lspci | grep VGA
that first command, do not paste the output of here... just look at the installed line... sorry for the multiple replies
http://pastebin.com/wW1Mxg85 after the first command
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
it is my opinion that your gpu has a problem.
can you run any other OS on this machine without issue playing video?
OK. I got an error message to that effect some days ago. I got it repeatedly, but I haven't seen it as of lately.
No, there's only this one installation of ubuntu here.
I am in the 85% range of a hw failure... and I am a conservative rater.
OK. What happened earlier on when I told you the pc hanged was I bit unusual. After playing the video for perhaps 30 seconds, it froze. The the screen went black, but with some blue at the top of the screen, and the audio kept playing. However, everything froze, and only a hard reset would work, all the while the audio going.

think I accidently installed for XORG on the ATI installer
don't know how
installed itself, I dont think it used the package manager
I didnt use sudo apt-get to install it

installed Cinnamon
was working fine for a long time, it's just this ATI thing that messed it up
cinnamon is not the problem, it's this ATI installer, I think it's forcing me to logon with xwindows or something
does Ubuntu normally start up?
sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
X draws everything on your screen, whether it's local or remote
like how, by drawing straight to framebuffer without drivers? =P
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System (i know nothing about windows, oldfart born with unixes :)
on long term, there are plans to replace X at some point with Wayland display server, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_%28display_server_protocol%29
going to fine details, on local machine X server talks to "clients" through unix sockets so nothing goes through network
and there are extensions to draw directly to the gpu, like what OpenGL games do
yes
sudo apt-get remove cinnamon && sudo apt-get install cinnamon
any particular reason why you installed amd driver manually?
if you have these things in your account dir, these won't be removed
you can install newer driver from ubuntu repositories too
only the default (package fglrx) is little outdated, but there is way to install updates as they get released (install package fglrx-updates)
also, it's possible to create proper .deb files out of ati's installer so nothing gets messed up in ubuntu
just try that reinstalling the cinnamon (it won't remove any settings from your home dir)
it gave me an error when I tried doing the deb thing, it said deb-clean was missing or something like that
http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Precise_Installation_Guide#Installing_Catalyst_Manually_.28from_AMD.2FATI.27s_site.29 this wiki has step-by-step instructions what you need to install to get it working
i still recommend just installing "fglrx-updates" package from repositories, works fine
http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Precise_Installation_Guide#Removing_Catalyst.2Ffglrx there's uninstall instructions
after that you can just install ubuntu-shipped "fglrx-updates" package to get newer driver, propely packaged
no one really codes "for X" nowadays anyway, everyone develops apps on top of qt/gtk/opengl and X is just an elephant in the corner rendering things on screen :)
am having trouble setting up my server
in what way?
what is the server offering as a service?
and what is the output of: hostname
then you have named the server localhost, which will cause issues
run: sudo -i
then run: nano /etc/hosts and edit one of the localhosts so that the name can resolve to 127.0.0.1
also run: nano /etc/hostname and change the name to the same name as in /etc/hosts this file sets the host name
setting those 2 files with the same name etc is how you change host name
yes, sudo -i is an interactive sudo
yes, set the hostname there as well as in /etc/hostname
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1290833/ for example
see how the name 'fileserver' also resolves to 127.0.0.1 as well as localhosts
yes, you then edit /etc/hostname to the SAME name (case sensitive)
you could add the command in /etc/rc.local to make it run at boot. add it above the 'exit 0' line :)
if you have a fix, just apply it. The command makes it work.
so that your interface gets a DHCP assigned IP as well as the DNS servers you use
possibly, I believe that is default
if you specify the addressing in /etc/network/interfaces it will be used, you can also tell it to ifup and use dhcp by dfefault
then this will help: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
you will need to manually specify nameservers
also, note that Hardy server is EOL in April next year, you may weant to upgrade soon
yes, you may need to define them in the interfaces file though
precise, you mean?
do you not get DHCP from your network devices?
I see, gotcha :)
do you not get DHCP? that is the default
all that is in my interfaces file is the loopback section
you can use this guide: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
if you want to use static IP, then yes
that will give a flly featured web host with sql and php and lots of other goodies
use cups to share printers
- I need Samba because there's some windows machine on my network
you can share with cups for windows machines
can you browse to https://localhost:631 ?
I'm on a client machine, but can't open server CUPS admin page from it...
ran nmap from a client to the server. Port 631 closed
hmm let me see how to enable it
I think by default it works localhost only
yep
well you'd need to run it from host machine then or via ssh forwarding
got linux clients?
regardless, I guess you could ssh forward ports
there is a webinterface line there, set it to yes, for reference here is my cupsd.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com/1330220/
- now open
now I enter, but gives me a Forbidden on navigator on the CUPS admin
try https
- i can see now the adminstration page
- I can now print from my machine
you mean all good now?
I guess you added the printer by http://ip_add:631/printers/printername right? if so, glad to have helped
windows 7?
- yes
just go to printers, add new printer
then the important step, Select printer by name and type: http://your_cups_ip:631/printers/printer_queue_name
printerqueue name can be found in the cups web interface
after that, make sure to select the correct driver, ps version (postscript)
- okay. Thanks!
let me know if it works
- worked okay on a Windows 7 64 bit machine
tbh I don't know
- okay. Thanks anyway.
it possible to make it so grub automatically boots the default choice with no delay or even showing itself UNLESS i hit a certain key?
nobody knows XD
yes, edit /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/header
what do i change specifically?
etc /etc/default/grub and change GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
if i change it to 0 grub wont ever appear right? and id have to boot into a liveCD to fix it if something went wrong?
now i have another strange question! can i change the ubuntu screen during boot to a custom graphic?
look for plymouth themes
is that a package i install?
i want it to be a CUSTOM graphic, not a premade theme
how would i do this?
/lib/plymouth/themes/
can you find for him the special flag for radeon hdmi audio they added to ubuntu to force it to work?
i think hes having that problem that that fixes
he must have an amd e-450 fusion apu if he has that gpu in a revo nettop XD
the hdmi audio fix for radeon might help him XD
he already confirmed he had the video driver installed
i haven't heard of that fix
sec ill find it for him and you
i have radeon 4200 and hdmi audio works well
terminalclient https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/864735
terminalclient did you guys see my link the 2nd time?
that just says it's disabled by default
it can be enabled in alsamixer by hitting > on spdif
yes, with no way to enable it, other than that line, or the catalyst drivers direct from amd
oh, ok
is there a specific resolution limit to the png i use for a plymouth theme?
most likely
would 640 x 480 be safe then? :P
use whatever resolution the other themes are using for their images
good idea!
a fresh install so no need to backup

i bet its not upgrading because .04 is a lts, and 12.10 is not... how would i disable that feature in xubuntu
i do that from the terminal>
did do-release-upgrade bekks , and i got:
for a new Ubuntu release
new release found



try this first - sudo apt-get install update-manager-core

more
/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal;
it on the man page bekks
-d
isnt update-manager a gnome program? or that wont matter on xfce?? im rinning a really slow computer.. i cant afford a bunch of dependencies
couldnt even put koloutpaint4, onde of my favs, a kde app, on here without sloweing it up
update-manager be ok?
what I read here - http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/upgrade-to-ubuntu-12-04-from-ubuntu-10-04-via-the-terminal/ - It says terminal only.

its updating
the support available here
a windows driver problem last week, and no one could fig it out online, so i called microsoft... and the support warranty was past due

is helpful even past the warranty stage, however... called them once about a 5 yr old box
thanks for the help... ill post a screenshot later if u guys want when i am done... im going to check out ubuntu-offtopic so i dont flood this chat and hurt peoples chances at getting help woth my chatter

used a Dell in years. Been using System76.
zork__ i will try it out
i have some old machines
how do u install ubuntu 1204 with only gnome 3 and no unity

I install Ubuntu from alternate CD, install command-line only system and then connect to wired network and install gnome from there
so install command, then aptget install gnome. is that it
is vlc not in ubuntu. totem is bad
i mean in install
know it is in repo
yeah, from the alternate CD, change the mode to Command-line system only ... then install run apt-get install gnome ... that will get you a pure gnome system, when complete reboot and you'll be presented with gdm to login :) ... done
other distros include it
ok
i dont konw but ubuntu is not usa
u are saying usa is less free. is that it
u said it

u install newest google chrome on ubuntu 804

Chrome dropped support for 8.04 from version 13
do u need analyzer
is a toy
msp301
y, i mean it is the same ubunut, only with older programs
804 or 1204
i dont use 804
am asking hypo qs
security issues arise in software, maintainers will only keep vulnerabilities patched for their supported software .. does that answer your question?
but if u dont care about security so it should work
software also has dependencies, maybe a feature that is used in a library is only available in that libary from a specific version, so Chrome in this case wouldn't be able to access its required feature from this library to run ... if its not available in 8.04, Chrome won't be able to run properly
but u download it from website, so there is no dep
oh, but there are :) ... Chrome uses GTK (I think) to show its graphical window and controls, to ship that with the Chrome application would be massive, so it would rely on you having GTK installed before it can be, make sense?
Google's site shows Chrome/Chromuim's deps here http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxBuildInstructionsPrerequisites

Why did you delete any partition?
What used to be on that partition? Ubuntu's installer will create space for its partitions automatically, doing so before hand just makes things more complicated.
Do you want to remove Ubuntu entirely?
I understand wanting Windows to be the default, but defaulting to the Windows boot screen will make it much harder to dual boot with Ubuntu, without any gain that I can see. Why do you want to do this?
OK, so you just want the grub menu to default to booting Windows. That's easy, and does not require easybcd.
Can you pastebin your /boot/grub/grub.cfg?
Like I said, defaulting to Windows is easy.
Please pastebin your /boot/grub/grub.cfg so I can find the proper value for GRUB_DEFAULT.
Run "gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub", which will bring up a text editor. Change GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT="Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)"
Then save and close the file and run "sudo update-grub" and try rebooting to test that it worked.
Can you pastebin the current contents of /etc/default/grub? You probably forgot the quotation marks.
Download the isos and then follow http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg#How_do_you_use_a_loopback.cfg_to_boot_an_iso.3F
Yup.
Are you trying to make an Ubuntu DVD to boot from or a USB drive with Ubuntu?
i am making Ubuntu DVD...but i'll create usb in future !!!
Why did you mention "usb disk creator" then? Was that a mistype or a misunderstanding of what the USB Startup Disk Creator is for?
thats a mayb mistype or misunderstanding....right now i want to create bootable ubuntu 12.04 dvd so i was asking if just doing dd will do the job or i'll have to use any other dvd burner softwares.....and for usb i'll make it in future (usb can be dd'ed ?)...!!!
dd can't be used to burn any type of CD/DVD. You'll have to use some type of burning software, but Brasero (GUI) and wodim (Terminal based) come by default with Ubuntu.
can u suggest any gud book on ubuntu and linux ins and outs ?
can help me? OSError: libnetfilter_conntrack.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
apt-cache search libnetfilter
install what seems fitting
libnetfilter-conntrack3 seems ok but I already have it installed
which program are you trying to start?
mallory
python program
is it an application from the official ubuntu repository?
no cloned from git
then that question might not be related to this channel.
I suggest asking the developer of that specific application
ok, thanks!!!
these depency problems are handled by the official ubuntu repositories, so your version of mallory is not within that scope
are you trying to run a binary from that git repository or have you compiled whatever you´re trying to run yourself?
being python, i just copied the entire repo and tried to run the file they indicate...
are you sure something within that is not trying to run some binary supplied outside of the official ubuntu packages?
I only see python files... but I don't know what it does exactly
python files should be no problem (.py)
but they should be generated automatically by the interpreter, right?
not sure about that, my python knowledge does not reach that far :p
yeah, I think so... I'm not sure either, but it is only some kind of optimization
you could always try this: https://github.com/intrepidusgroup/mallory/issues
have you used this? https://github.com/intrepidusgroup/mallory/blob/master/mallory_install.sh
yeah... It seems I solved it. In the official repo there is version 3... this prog was looking for version 1... i just made a sym link with the right name
pretty dirty hack, but it might suit ;)
not sure it will work, but at least it runs
do expect segfaults
I do!!! Dirty hack for a dirty work I'm trying to do... I'm trying to test the security of some applications using ssl, with a man in the middle attack... I don't know where to start!!!
you might want to use Backtrack for that, if the livedvd contains your tool it probably works out of the box
any questions about it will be gladly answerred there, I hope XD
thanks again!!!
fancy walking me through ATI driver setup??
can't help. i use the Free "radeon" drivers for my AMD grfx
why do you think you need the proprietary AMD drivers instead of the Free ones?
pastebin the output of "lsmod | grep adeon"
pastebin the output of "lsmod | grep adeon" (second attempt here)
no output bro
pretty fresh when it comes to linux.
is the machine not displaying video correctly?
i feel the video on stream is sluggish, was never like that, im thinking whether the prop drivers might be better, but seems ok. 3d works ok, compiz etc
why wouldnt the prop drivers be better?
well, for one proprietary software makes you depenedent upon a singkle vendor for fixes. also, on my AMD E-350 APU ThinkPad, the proprietary AMD drivers render the machine unbootable.
and if its all working ??
that's certainly not true for everyone. many people use the AMD proprietary drivers. but i don't. and if your machine is mostly working, why take the chance of breaking something for a few extra FPS?
look through the full output of "lsmod"
what is the command line>
"lsmod"
and what should i bee looking for?
look for anything relating to video that will tell you what driver you are using.
videodev 85626 1 uvcvideo
"video" is in that line, but it's misleading. that's not the video driver. keep looking.
also, the X1200 is a very old chip. you're not going to get great performance no matter what driver you use.
video 18908 0 ati_agp 13242 0
thats all i reckon unless i private you the whole thing, i get its old, but under windows it worked no probs, just trying to get the same results
well, you can give up on the proprietary drivers, as that chipset (X1xxx) is not supported by AMD any more.
i figured as much, but what drivers am i using then..
the drivers included for that chipset in the Linux kernel.
MestreLion: yeh i know, but i can use FLGRX
one last time. your X1200 chip IS NOT SUPPORTED by the AMD propietary driver. go ahead, install it. watch it render your system unbootable and unusable.
that 3 year old driver ... does the Linux kernel at the 3 series still support the ABI necessary to make the driver function?
when i check what drivers im using in the graphics section it says none
the dribver you are using is the best driver solution you are going to have. you have to live with it.
have java installed on my system but my browser says you need java for the application to run
could be the issue
have you enabled it in the browser?:P
How to enable it?
How shall I enable it on browser
are you using firefox?
yes
did you restart the browser by the way?
if not, go to edit > preferences
Do i need to enable javascript under Preference > Content..thats it
yes, does it work now?:P
restarting the browser, perhaps a reboot too before we go any further
No
?
I enabled java script but still says System Compatibilty issue
did you restart the browser??:P
wait, what do you need javascript for?? videos?:P
I need to run Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop client for which I need Java 1.6 and firefox2+
I installed firefox through apt-get and I do have java 1.6_0_22 installed
go to synaptic
and right-click both the firefox install you have and the java thing you're talking about, and go to properties
see if there are any dependencies missing
Thats from openjdk
It came through Ubuntu
Is there a seperate piece of java for system and Web Browser
does the package you downloaded say it works with fireforx?
Client prerequisites: • Java 1.6 (Sun or OpenJDK) • Web browser: Firefox 2+, Internet Explorer 7+, Google Chrome 9+, Safari 5+
try a reboot before we dig deeper?:P
I rebooted but the same error "System Compatibiltiy Issue..Either java is not installed on your system or on the browser.Please install java extensions on your browser"
give it a try with another browser that works
... with that java you installed
boot_info_script won't run
followed the directions to the T, but I'm getting that there's no such file or directoruy
can see the file too
how are you trying to run it, and from which directory relative to the file?
firstly, a file must have eXecute permissions for your user; second, if it isn't in the shell's PATH you have to specify it's path and name to start it. By default - unlike Windows - Linux does NOT include the current directory in the PATH
So, assuming the file is executable you'd run a program in the same directory using ./<programname>
"*" is not a legal character in a filename. That's a shell glob expansion character.
does the script have execute permissions "ls -l ~/Downloads/bootinfoscript*.sh" ?
^^^ I just gave you the command to use to check
Does the file exist ?
use "ls" to check if you've got the filename exactly correct: "ls -l ~/Downloads/*.sh"
I agree with you 200% :p
We'll help you get there :)
Hmmm!
How can you be 'seeing' it if the directory doesn't exist?
What's the complete path to the folder?
The overview is this, there's 446 bytes in the first sector of the boot disk that currently contain the Windows boot-strap loader. GRUB should have replaced that with it's own boot-strap, but for some reason, hasn't
that boot-strap loader is small so all it can do is find and load a few more sectors from the disk which contain some more substantial code for booting. That code is usually stored in sectors 2 to approx 2000. *that* code will then find and read the partition with the grub modules and menu in (/boot/grub/) and finally do the menu and/or load the default/chosen OS
So far as we can tell all that is missing is the first sector. It may be that the following stage sectors aren't there also, but we'd need to test to discover that.
Ok
Can you guide me through this in your best "for dummies" impersonation?
what's the make/model of that PC? I can check if it has proper BIOS boot-sector protection that may stop the boot sector being written
I'm trying my hardest already :D
Lenovo Y580
There are two variations of the Y580, mine is the 1080p one
The name is the same though
thanks
You'll be please to know, that model has caused this exact same issue for others installing Ubuntu

all, anyone had issues with javascript not working on 12.04 ?
java script in a browser?
yes, chrome, chromium & firefox
usually js is completely interpreted by the browser. so if the browser runs js should too.
yes indeed, however across multiple broswers, getting the same issues. i.e. on newegg.com, the login tab is missing all texts and links
what about other pages? like irc webchats etc... and are you sure you didn't disable js?
it's odd, some js elements seem to be working, but quite a few aren't, this is off a fresh install of 12.04, the only things migrated were .bashrc and google chrome settings
mhm dunno, sounds to me like it's the page's fault and not your os ;)
I thought it could be, but it's across multiple pages, amazon.com, newegg primarily
very weird. maybe it's a connection issue and js can't load contents with ajax?
are you using some kind of proxy?
perhaps.... I was running 12.04 beta on my work machine without issues, and 11.10 was doing odd things at home
I was, but just bypassed it as part of the troubleshooting
was running squid3 on the home server
well could be a proxy issue, try without
consider using vpn instead of proxy... much better :P
you there?
now :P
weird, literally just got back on my machine


does it work now?
yeah
it was the proxy?
wanted to kick myself, I set the SPI firewall in DD-WRT to filter java applets
:P
:D
It dawned on me when my roommate told me he couldn't get onto facebook
are you filtering everybody's traffic there? :P

nobody can answer to me
google search provides nothing?
much info in google / RyoRonin
thought about quiqly solvation
is it a tar.xz file?

sorry
is tar.gz
already install , i checked in synaptic , but how to use


tar xvfJ filename.tar.xz
zxvf /root/Desktop/Downloads/flashplayer10_2_p3_64bit_linux_111710.tar.gz
it correct?

you said was a xz file. so it is a gz file?
. i said gz file
yeah that should work or go directly to the file. tar zxvf filename.tar.gz
http://www.littleigloo.org/linux/how-to/uncompress-linux-files.html should give you for any other archived files.

finally switched to ubuntu
got sick of win
been using it for 8h straight
unity is as confusing as metro on win8
i switched to kubuntu desktop

that a good move
It's a personal choice
confusing and slow
yeah
forgot something to ask
been having problems with fonts
move to create a spinoff channel, #ubuntu-circlejerk , where discussions such as "unity sucks lol" can occur
turned on antialising but still doesnt hep much
Try setting the subpixel smoothing to "full"
than "slight"

a moment
and what font would u suggest me to use
font do you use
For applications? Whatever the default is
using liberatian-mono

If it looks good, it is good
full, right?
Yes
just forgot to mention that part.
thanks ;)
but it sounds like even if its plausible it certainly adds a nontrivial amount of complication to the process

What filesystem is /dev/md0?
Hmmm.. That makes no sense.
does this contribute anything useful? http://pastebin.com/7NVfeVvK
Hmmm, no. All looks normal. What about dmesg | grep md0

And the output of mount | grep md0?
http://pastebin.com/yp1tMjmc
so nothing seems problematic? should I take it to ubunto forums then?
I never saw the mount output.

Hmmm..
Yeah, that's very wierd.. There's no viable explaination as to why that could happen, on an ext4 filesystem.
Works great. :)
the drives are basically all brand new, i made the raid array, unplugged a drive and it built my hot swap successfully (as a test), i did mkfs.ext4 on the file system, i just havent been able to actually write any data on it, but ok ill go to the forums, the worst part is that the whole point of this is to protect my data, and in the process i've already spent 1100$s and even going to the point of unplugging the data drives to w
Good off-site backup that I use and like, is CrashPlan.
i think i looked into crash plan, but i just dont see how online backup of 8 tb of data would even work
but like, it would take months just to upload/download copies of it (at my internet speed) or else its like 130 bucks for them to mail you each drive to bypass the uploading/downloading, for that price I could by new drives
What's your internet speed for uploads?
slow, i think i'm paying for 30mbps down maybe 15-20 up
and the way the ISPs i have found work, you get in trouble if you use it all all month, when you pass downloading about 3-400 tb a month they start calling you and accusing you of "abusing service" and threatening to terminate your account
I just did the math, based on 15mb/s upload rate. 8TB would 20 hours.
maybe i'm just a porn fiend ;)
Uhh... I'm leaning on other things, which are a lot less pleasant.
it doesnt?

if you are interested, it turned out that the problem was the permissions on /media/vault. after a sudo chmod a+rw /media/vault everything works fine
I've got problem with TwinView, two nvidia graphic cards. 2nd screen is white, and xorg.conf keeps to setting "TwinView" in both screens to "0".
I had that issue.
did you fix it?
In the Nvidia menu editor, click the box at the top. Hold on, let me get the exact words.
Yea, enable Xinerama.
Oh, I know. Although with Xinerama, i had an issue then with xrandr
Ah, I see. Did you save it to the X Configuration file?
to the "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" yep
I am using Ubuntu since yesterday, Im pretty fresh here, sorry :P
THat's fine, I'm here for an issue you'll probably have after we get your monitor to display correctly, Unity gets buggy with two monitors sometimes.
I see. May we get on PM, or something? So we won't flood here? :P
Well, I don't know what is wrong with it now that my answer didn't work, so until I tell you another option, I'm stumped.
actually Xinerama works fine wih dual screen
just the problem is that if I enable Xinerama, it also makes me having "randr" expansion off
But you get a white screen then?
if I switch Xinerama off - yes, I do have a white screen on second screen. Although, if I switch Xinerama on, it works just fine.
Where is this randr option? I don't see one for it. WHat does it do?
type in terminal "xrandr -v"
let's go on PM, it'll be easier
hello again. Are you there?
Hey, yea.
there's an issue I hadn't met before.
now I have two task bars on two screens D:
Same issue here, trying to get it solved but nobody seems to know what the issue is.
funny thing is that I haven't had that before on xinerama lol
Also, to confirm something, try to click on a top bar menu, does it close right away?
what do you exactly mean?
The top bar, with file, edit, etc.
yep, it's working fine
on both screens
Ah, Well I have a seperate issue then.

a binary always execute when we give ./binary?
granted there aren't any issues with the binary itself, yes.
issues like?
incompletely built, wrong architecture, etc.
ok, If it is incompletely built, why do they ship a binary after all?
sorry i just stepped in. what issue are you having?
I was trying to install an editor called sublime. It has a binary called sublime_text. When I do ./sublime_text it is not working.
you installed from source?
Ill tell you. I downloaded the tar.bz2 and unzipped it. Thats all I did.
cd into the directory. then run ./configure
there is no file configure . 'Icon', 'PackageSetup.py', 'lib', 'sublime_text', 'sublime_plugin.py', 'Pristine Packages' . These are the only files present.
pls send me the link that you downloaded it from.
i'll try to see what's going on.

linux 64 bit
sure. :) Actually this is what I thought. ---If there is an executable shipped along then, it must straight away execute--
i'll unpack these and see what's happening, friend. i've got a 32 bit install but i'll look at the 64 bit as well.
sure
i unpacked the 32 bit. i was surprised to actually find the precompiled binary. simply running ./sublime_text from the command line executed it.
that looks like a good editor. thanks for bringing it to my attention. I may take another look at it should vim fall off the planet. :)
it was wrong architecture. simple solution learned the hard way :P
oh wow. yeah. know you're arch. lol
If I might make a suggestion... backup what you need on this drive before proceeding, just in case, to get back where you are. I strongly recommend clonezilla.

can you boot -nomodset
I cant seem to chroot my drive to update grub at all either. I keep getting errors. I think I dont know enough in that area to do it.
What do you mean where in the process?
I don't know if you have installed successfully or you are trying to again, I know only that you get no load of whatever you are trying to do.
I can install fine. But I cant get it to boot or even show me a grub menu.
can you get recovery console booting while holding space?
Nope. I cant get to anything after the bios.
I can walk you through chrooting
That would be helpful, thanks. Would team viewer help at all?
I can install Vic or whatever is easier for you. im on a live cd. Lol.

It's a 64 bit everything. i7 960 I think.
I don't think your install went happy.
this is the exact same disk you installed with right?
more like installed version of ubu is 64 and your disk is 32
the pae kernel will see large ram too... one second
I am not worried about the hardware, but the version on cd, and version installed... that is why I am asking if the DISK is the same one that you installed with.
what does uname -m say
the 64 bit would never install if the hw did not support.
x86_64 is 64, i6/386 is 32...
this only means that the live version is 64. I again do not know what you have installed or installed from
Tis morning I used update grub to add the SSD instll to the grub on the HD and it worked. It it tried to load but then it spewed errors out during boot.
I wonder if this is the type of errors one might see after the drive is used up, too many writes?
Ok time to try installing 32bit to sdb. :)
Did you see that. Installing to sdb SSD is working fine.
That is very interesting, great news as well... but very confusing

chroot in. modify /etc/default/grub, update-grub
how to chroot? and what to modify?
but in my ubuntu installation / and /boot are separate
once you look at /etc/default/grub it should be fairly clear what the relevant options are.
so?
chroot will just mount / and not the /boot right? or not?
chroot doesn't mount anything. you have to do the mounts before you call chroot
ok
you need to mount your system root, your /boot, bind mount your dev, maybe also your proc and sys, and then you can chroot in
ok
also if your fedora is 32bit and ubuntu is 64bit chroot wont work
:-o right. my fedora is 32 bit. and ubuntu 64 bit.
any other way?

how can i add this liveuser to the sudoers list? so that i can edit?
sudo chroot, gives you a uid 0 chroot
sudo chroot liveuser is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.
i have no idea what you are doing or what liveuser is
liveuser is when we are running fedora from live usb media

i was just trying to directly edit /etc/default/grub from fedora. but i think now i should try ubuntu. i just remember that i have one extra ubuntu beta in my backup hdd i will go and run it. thank you for your efforts escott and ActionParsnip brb :-)
if you need root access in a chroot you sudo prior to the chroot call. so sudo -i; blah blah blah; chroot or sudo chroot /path/to/whatever
ok

sounds good
write down the three steps i said and run them after these commands 1) sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current 2) sudo apt-get install nvidia-current

good luck
I was wondering how I could give the user account "www-data" root privileges.
If you did that, your system would be owned within minutes
How so? :O
How so what?
Oh that one. Well, any tiny hole in the webserver or its appllications would give an attacker instant root access
Or if there's a security hole in php or the webserver
you give www-data permission to run that one script as root without requiring a password. You do that in sudoers. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
You're a legend
Of course, you better make sure that script doesn't have any bugs. I.e. make sure it's not using eval, no unquoted parameter expansions etc
Can you help me to understand that article a little more, I'm very new to linux and this is crucial for my open source project :)
Ah, I seem to remember it explaining how to edit the sudoers file. There's the man-page of sudoers at the bottom at least
Ah, there we go, it was a separate page. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers
Yeah i got it thanks :)
sudo <command> `openssl passwd blahblah` shouldn't that work?
sudo <command> -p `openssl passwd blahblah` shouldn't that work? [correction]
no
It merely changes the password prompt from "[sudo] password for yourusername:" to a passwordhash
So correct me if I'm wrong I just put "sudo -i root" at the start of the script I want to give root privileges.
wrong. You run the script with sudo scriptname or sudo /path/to/scriptname if it's not in PATH
If scriptname.sh is in a directory in that process' PATH variable, yes. On a side note, you should put extensions on script files.
sorry, you *shouldn't* put extensions on script files.
Okay thanks :)
When I do "sudo scriptname.sh" it says: "sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified"
Then you haven't given that user permission to run that script, or the script is not in PATH
How can I put that script in PATH? (sorry for the persistent asking of questions)
Difficult to say without more context. You're running it from php? then check how to alter environment variables in php. The easy way out is to provide the absolute path to the script in this case though.
sudo /path/to/script
I'm already doing that, this is my actual script: echo shell_exec("sudo /home/XiRoN/Scripts/createServer.sh Dog Dog 256 25567 2>&1"); the bash script has 4 parameteres
And what does the sudoers line look like?
Oh and does the user have access to that directory in your homedir?
I chowned the files to www-data
all! I'm experiencing slowness (100kb max) on my network interface on Ubuntu 12.10. I'm a little lost as to what I need to do to fix the issue. Any ideas?
wget https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/sysctl; cat ./sysctl | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf > /dev/null; sudo sysctl -p
thanks, I've applied and I'm bouncing the box now
should add more memory to networking, makes thinsg a bit better
The new sysctl didn't do the trick unfortunately. I can get files from the server at about 9MB/s, but sending files to the server / downloading files on the server usually hits a hall at 100K/s. That new config added 40K/s to the overall speed, but it's not quite there.
also try disabling ipv6
what's weird is that SABNZBd can do 2.2MB/s over the interet using the same connection.. Which is odd
already disabled it to help troubleshoot
if you run: sudo lshw -C network what network chip are you using?
Output from that command: http://pastebin.com/S1YVrGSQ
if you run: ifconfig; lsb_release -a what is output please?
sure: http://pastebin.com/2W5AXyDm :)
you have a 10% error packets recieved.
tried a different cable, or port on the router / switch?
is it 100Mb ethernet?
the cabling? I think it's standard cat 5e to a 1gbps switch. Never had issues with the cabling in the past
is the router 1Gbps too?
try:  sudo apt-get install ethtool; sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 duplex full
OK, done. I'm assuming that's forced the card into a particular state?
may help
its active immediately :)
sudo lshw -C network will show the state
thanks, but it hasn't worked :( http://cl.ly/image/1o0e3O2Z343f .. I'm sending a file over SSH in transmit with the same results. SMB transfers are pants too
.. anyway, it was uploading at 100Kb/s again
so we're ok now?
I'm afraid not. Transfers going into the server are still slow. Downloading from the server are still fine!
I find it strange that some apps like SABNZBd can also download at my 2.2MBps (maxing out our internet connection), but a standard wget only downloads at 100Kbps.
internal transfers can download from the server fine, but uploads to the server are so slow :(
i'd try a new cable, try a different port
I'll do that now. Brb!
new cable, new port.. No change :( .. Could it be something weird with the card I'm using? I'm considering going out and buying a new card.
